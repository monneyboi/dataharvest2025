`index.html` is a Reveal.js presentation on the GraphRAG ecosystem for the DataHarvest 2025 conference.

## Session Description

A high level overview of the GraphRAG ecosystem. We aim to show:
- What GraphRAG is, and how it works
- How to prepare your documents
- How to build your own graph.
- How to interface with your graph using Python

These techniques can be used to gain a visual overview of the contents of document sets, and to find information in the documents without having to rely on keywords. Put simply, it enables you to make sense of large amounts of documents without having to read them all.

In the session you'll be making a graph from arbitrary documents, visualizing it, and using it to answer questions.

It will help if you've heard of RAG before, but this is not a prerequisite. To follow along, all you need is a browser and an e-mail address.
